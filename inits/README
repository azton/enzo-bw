This is close to the original version of Inits 2001.
This is a single thread, non-MPI, shared-memory code.

This version uses the standard C library routine drand48()
but any random number generator can be use by modifying
the routines enzo_seed() and enzo_rand().

drand48 is probably sufficient up to 1024^3.
For > 1024^3, use one of the other versions with SPRNG.
For compatibility with ENZO prior to 2002, use one of
the versions that reads a pre-defined random number
sequence and generate the sequence with random/Ungood
which uses the ancient ran1.src generator.

This is a 64-bit floating point version (only) but one
may select 32-bit or 64-bit integers.  32-bit integers
are acceptable for up to 1024^3, which is the largest
size that can be run safely with a drand48() random sequence.
